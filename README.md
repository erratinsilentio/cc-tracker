## About The Project

- ###### This is a work in progress

I really wanted to explore what Vue.js had to offer compared to React. Around the same time I had an interest in calisthenics and stumbled upon the Recommended Routine on Reddit. There was a lot of info and I wanted to simplify it, make everything including videos available at one place. Another feature I had on my mind was being able to log your workouts with basic info like current progression level and today's reps.

## Built With

Like I have said, aim of this project is learning Vue, therefore technologies used are:

- Vue 3
- Pinia
- Supabase

Later on I plan on adding animations and we will see what else.

## Getting Started

I encourage everyone curious to expand this website, report issues and clone the repository for themselves.

### Prerequisites

To install this project make sure you have node.js installed on your PC

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:erratinsilentio/routine-tracker.git
```

2. Move into project directory

```sh
cd routine-tracker/app
```

3. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

Website is very simple. For user that is not logged in, there is an exercises tab to explore. There you will have all the main exercises with their progressions listed, with videos or pictures provided. I look forward to expanding this section in the future, right now my plan is to keep it basic till completed.

Now, if you want to log your workouts, you have to Log in from /login tab. There you will have a button to login via Google. After successful, you can now enter Workouts tab and add them how you want.
